This code is an implementation of a two-player space game using Pygame library. It creates a window, two spaceships, and allows them to shoot bullets at each other.

The Game class contains all the methods and attributes needed for the game. The __init__ method initializes Pygame, sets up the window, loads the images and sounds, and defines some constants.

The draw_window method draws the spaceships and bullets, updates the health bars, and the background of the window. The draw_winner method displays the winner of the game after it ends.

The handle_ship_movement method moves the spaceships according to the keyboard inputs. The shoot method creates bullets and handles collisions.

The main loop of the game is in the main function. It handles events, updates the positions of the spaceships and bullets, checks for collisions, and ends the game if a player's health is 0.
